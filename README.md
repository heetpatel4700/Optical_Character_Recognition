Need to extract text from an image?

Tired of manually transcribing?

You need OCR!

OCR, also known as Optical Character Recognition allows you to 'recognise' text from within a document, whether it be an image, a PDF or a table. Leveraging OCR, you can easily extract this text to be able to use it for additional processing, NLP, or fit it into your regular workflow. 

The great thing about EasyOCR is that it works with Python and is quite accurate without any fine tuning, this means you can spend less time processing and more time doing the fun stuff.
